// You have a list of “green” numbers and a list of “red” numbers.
// Complete the code to print how many numbers there are in total.

// Exercise 2
// You have a set of protocols supported by your server.
// A user requests to use a particular protocol.
// Complete the program to check whether the requested protocol is supported or
// not (isSupported must be a Boolean value).

// Exercise 3
// Define a map that relates integer numbers from 1 to 3 to their corresponding spelling.
// Use this map to spell the given number.
